# Grading Guideline

Often students ask 
> How will we be assessed on a homework assignment?

Believe it or not, this is an excellent question.  This document provides a grading guideline and philosophy.  What you will find is that the grading process is very fair and very transparent.  By laying out our expectations upfront, students have the benefit of learning and receving the most accurate feedback on their work.  The goal of grading is not to penalize students, instead, it is to accurately assess performance.

## The Grading Rubric

Each assignment comes with a grading rubric.  The grading rubric has two purposes:
* It serves as a checklist for you to work the assignment 
* It sets clear expectations of the assignment

We will examine each item in the rubric and assess as followed:
* `0` Not completed
* `1` Low quality work -- barely meets requirement; missing many features and objectives
* `2` Medium quality work -- meets requirement; missing some features and objectives
* `3` High quality work -- meets requirement; missing no features or objectives
* `4` Excellent work -- above and beyond what is expected!

## Code Contribution 

We often hear 
> But we type together.

To this we respond 
> That is wonderful to hear.

For this class, we expect for you to collaborate on the design and architecture; however, we also expect for you write and contribute code individually.

For collaborative assignments, students are expected to use a code-sharing tool such as [Github](http://github.com).  While it is debatable that the number of lines of code contributed by individual members can serve as an accurate metric of efforts, we feel that it can serve as an starting point.  In our view, the number of code commits, frequency of code commits, timeline of code commits, and comments associated with code commits, serve as a much better tool for measuring contribution.  

In this regard, **each team with need to provide their git log and git activity graphs.** We will examine the git log and activity graphs, and assess as followed:
* If contribution is relatively balance and there are no commit anomalities, all team members will receive full contribution credit.  Typically `3` points.
* If contribution is not balance, the most active person will receive `3` points, others will receive `2`, `1` or `0` (depending on how much and how often).

## Code Comprehension

We often find students demonstrate their mastery of the web-search and cut-and-paste skills.  To this extent, we acknowledge your wizardry.  However, we expect that you must not forget to: **cite your source**.

Regarding understanding of the code itself, we will make two bold assumptions:
* Since you wrote the code, you must understand what you have written.  
* Your code **must not** be similar to that of another team.

Regarding the review process, you should make a bold assumption: the instructors know a little bit about programming, algorithms, and CS theory.  Therefore, consider the following:
* We can quickly identify similar and familiar code.  If your code is taken from another source and is without proper citation, we must address the oversight.  Depending on the severity of the violation, your team can receive up to a `0` for the assignment.  In extreme cases, for example, if your code lifted completely from another team, you will receive an `F` for the course.
* We can, with some efforts, comprehend the intent of your code.  If your code does not match your explanation, we will need to de-conflict the descrepancy.

The point of the code comprehension portion is to ensure that you have properly completed and that you comprehend the assignment.  If we feel that you do not understand the code, the assignment is not accepted and you will need submit it again when ready.
